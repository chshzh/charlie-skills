# Professional Answer Polishing

## Purpose

Help craft or refine responses to customers, colleagues, or stakeholders that are:
- Friendly and approachable
- Professional and respectful
- Clear and easy to understand
- Free of jargon (or jargon is explained)
- Action-oriented when needed

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user needs to:
- Draft an email or message to a customer
- Respond to a colleague's question
- Explain technical concepts to non-technical audiences
- Provide status updates or reports
- Handle difficult or sensitive situations
- Clarify requirements or ask for information

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarity Over Cleverness
- Use simple, direct language
- Avoid unnecessary technical terms
- If technical terms are needed, explain them briefly
- Break complex ideas into digestible parts

### 2. Professional Tone
- Be polite and respectful
- Avoid overly casual language (unless appropriate for the relationship)
- Stay positive and solution-focused
- Use "we" and "I" appropriately to show ownership

### 3. Structure and Organization
- Start with the main point or answer
- Provide context and details as needed
- End with clear next steps or calls to action
- Use formatting (bullets, numbering) for readability

### 4. Empathy and Understanding
- Acknowledge the other person's situation or concerns
- Show appreciation for their time or patience
- Be honest about limitations while offering alternatives
- Maintain a helpful, can-do attitude

## Response Framework

### Opening
- Greeting appropriate to the relationship
- Brief acknowledgment of their message or situation
- Express appreciation if relevant

### Body
- Lead with the most important information
- Provide necessary context and details
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Include examples or analogies for complex topics
- Break down steps or options clearly

### Closing
- Summarize key points if needed
- Clearly state next steps or actions
- Invite questions or further discussion
- Professional sign-off

## Common Scenarios

### 1. Answering a Question
```
Structure:
1. Direct answer first
2. Supporting details
3. Additional resources or context
4. Invitation to follow up
```

### 2. Providing Status Update
```
Structure:
1. Current status/progress
2. What's been completed
3. Any blockers or delays (with solutions)
4. Next steps and timeline
```

### 3. Explaining a Technical Issue
```
Structure:
1. Plain language summary
2. What happened (avoid blame)
3. Impact and what it means for them
4. Resolution or plan forward
5. How to prevent recurrence (if relevant)
```

### 4. Making a Request
```
Structure:
1. Context for the request
2. Specific ask (what you need)
3. Why it's needed
4. Deadline or timeline
5. Thank them in advance
```

### 5. Delivering Bad News
```
Structure:
1. Lead with facts (don't bury the news)
2. Explain why/what happened
3. Show empathy for impact
4. Offer solutions or alternatives
5. Clear next steps
```

## Language Tips

### Replace This → With This
- "As per my last email" → "As I mentioned previously"
- "You failed to..." → "We didn't receive..."
- "That's not my job" → "Let me connect you with the right person"
- "I think/maybe/possibly" → "I recommend" or "The best approach is"
- "ASAP" → Specific timeframe
- "Obviously" or "Clearly" → Remove entirely (can sound condescending)
- "Just" (minimizing) → Remove or be specific
- "Sorry for bothering you" → "Thank you for your time"

### Power Words
- Use: "recommend," "suggest," "propose," "ensure," "achieve"
- Avoid: "try," "attempt," "might," "should," "hopefully"

### Active Voice
- Instead of: "The issue was discovered"
- Use: "We discovered the issue"

## Example Transformations

### Before (Too Casual/Unclear)
```
Hey, so I looked at that thing you sent and it's kinda broken.
Not sure what happened but it might be the config or something.
Can you check it out and let me know?
```

### After (Professional & Clear)
```
Hi [Name],

Thank you for sending over the configuration file. I've reviewed it
and identified an issue with the database connection settings on line 47.

The hostname format appears to be incorrect, which would prevent the
application from connecting to the database. Could you please update
it to match this pattern: hostname:port?

Once you've made the change, I'm happy to review it again to ensure
everything is working correctly.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

### Before (Too Technical)
```
The API endpoint is returning a 503 error due to upstream service
degradation. We've implemented exponential backoff with jitter in
the retry logic to mitigate the issue.
```

### After (Accessible)
```
We're experiencing intermittent connection issues with one of our
partner services, which is causing some requests to fail temporarily.

To minimize the impact, we've updated our system to automatically
retry failed requests with smart timing to avoid overwhelming the
service. This should help maintain stability while the partner
resolves their issue.

I'll keep you updated on the situation and let you know once it's
fully resolved.
```

## Workflow

When the user provides text to polish:

1. **Understand the context**
   - Who is the audience?
   - What's the relationship (customer, colleague, manager)?
   - What's the goal of the message?

2. **Identify issues**
   - Tone problems (too casual, too formal, defensive)
   - Clarity issues (jargon, unclear structure)
   - Missing elements (next steps, context)

3. **Restructure if needed**
   - Apply appropriate framework
   - Lead with key information
   - Add necessary context
   - Include clear action items

4. **Refine language**
   - Simplify complex terms
   - Remove weak or negative phrasing
   - Ensure professional but friendly tone
   - Check for empathy and respect

5. **Present the polished version**
   - Show the improved text
   - Briefly explain key changes made
   - Offer alternative phrasings if relevant

## Notes

- Always maintain the user's core message and intent
- Adjust formality level based on the specific context
- When in doubt, err on the side of clarity and professionalism
- Cultural context matters—adapt advice based on regional norms if specified
- For sensitive situations, offer multiple phrasing options
