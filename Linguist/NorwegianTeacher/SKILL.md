## Tips for Effective Teaching

3. **Relate to known concepts**: Compare to English when helpful
4. **Celebrate cognates**: Point out similarities (hus/house, ball/ball)
5. **Warn about false friends**: Words that look similar but differ (gift = married/poison)
6. **Use authentic examples**: Real Norwegian sentences, not overly simplified
7. **Encourage questions**: If usage isn't clear, provide more examples

## Example Complete Response

**Response:**

**bok** = book

**Noun Forms (feminine/common):**
- ei bok / en bok (a book)
- boka / boken (the book)

**Usage Notes:**
"Bok" is a common noun that can be treated as either feminine (ei bok → boka) or masculine/common gender (en bok → boken) in Bokmål. The feminine form is more traditional, but the common gender form is widely used, especially in urban areas.
