## 🚀 Usage

Skills are designed to be referenced by Claude during conversations. Each skill provides:
- Templates and configurations
- Documentation and guides
- Automation scripts
- Best practices

### Invocation Pattern

- Declare the role, domain, and desired skill, for example: “As Developer of NCS, I want to do env-setup with NCS 3.2.1.”
- Claude maps the role to the matching directory (Developer, ProductManager, linguist) and loads the requested sub-skill (env-setup, project, features, review, etc.).
- Mention additional context (board, SDK version, target feature) so the assistant pulls the relevant files within that subdirectory.
